# hi love,

hi baby first of all i just wanna say sorry to you for what i did last thursday and for how im treating you as my girlfriend and also my behavior and my actions to you recently. ako pa talaga may gana mag initiate ng cool off kahit ikaw na nasaktan, ewan. pero i've been thinking these past few sleepless nights that im letting my pride get in the way (ayaw magpatalo, mga gusto nya lang gusto nya sundin, etc.) and i think this is the main reason  na nagcacause ng petty fights, immature arguments and this is not fair to you baby. i value our relationship so much love and it was never my intention to cause you pain and sufferings love. im sorry, love.for acting like this as your partner. this time i want you to know that i acknowledge that i hurt you and i take full responsibility for all these actions of mine. i just want to reassure you rin this time love na you are the only one that i love and wala ng iba. walang before you and never rin magkakaron ng after you. TANDAAN MO YAN. i deeply regret my actions the way im treating you :(( you deserve to be treated with kindness, respect, and LOVE. and i didnt meet these standards. you're a very important person in my life and seeing the pain ive cause you breaks my heart </3. 

i want to be the partner you deserve - someone who respects you, supports you, and loves you.

i wanna be the man that will make the little girl in you happy, seen, heard, loved and appreciated.

di ko alam kung pang ilan na to pero please know that im fully committed to changing my behavior and to becoming a BETTER MAN for you. and this cool off that i initiated help me understand myself and my treatment to you.

im sorry again my baby.

'Di na mabilang ang ating mga tampuhan
Away-bati natin, 'di na namamalayan
Eto tayo
Ngunit sa huli, palagi

Babalik pa rin sa yakap mo

i love you, palagi.

i want you to be my girlfriend, again.

with all my sincerity,

dian
